# LAB3 ~ Creating our Apache role

## Installing our packages
Now that we have the mysql server configured we will need to create a role for our webserver and its dependencies.
Similar to what we have done before lets go back into the name.apache/tasks folder and open up the main.yml file.  

Lets construct a play to install the libraries we need.
```yml
- name: install web components
  apt:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
    update_cache: yes
  with_items:
    - "{{ pythonreq }}"
```
Here we are going to loop through the packages we want to install. Lets provide our defaults list with the correct packages we need.
```yml
pythonreq:
    - apache2
    - libapache2-mod-wsgi
    - python-pip
    - python-virtualenv
    - python-mysqldb
    - git
```
The list above encompasses the requirements we need to run our flask application. We start off by installing our apache web server. We then add the python libraries we will need to host our app and finally we add git so the web server can grab the latest files from our repository.

## Configuring Apache for Flask
Now we have our packages installed we should check that they installed correctly lets use the service module again to ensure apache is running
```yml
- name: ensure apache2 started
  service:
    name: apache2
    state: started
    enabled: yes
```
[apache2_module doc](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/apache2_module_module.html)

Also we should ensure that the wsgi mod we stated in our defaults has loaded correctly. We are using a new module for this. The apache2_module.
```yml
- name: ensure mod_wsgi enabled
  apache2_module:
    state: present
    name: wsgi
  notify: restart apache2
```
the name simply states the apache module we want. As we will be hosting on apache2 we need the wsgi module so our application can interface with it.
## Cloning our Application
Our webserver is configured and we can start deploying our application. Our first step is going to be to pull it from git. For this we will use the git ansible module

```yml
- name: clone demo app source
  git:
    dest: /tmp/demo
    repo: https://Pudd1ng@gitlab.com/Pudd1ng/DemoFlask.git
  notify: restart apache2
  ```
  Be sure that the destination is the same as we will be referring to these files later in the playbook.
## Hosting the application
Once we have the files required on the box lets copy them over to the apache2 root directory.
```yml
- name: copy demo app files
  copy:
    src: /tmp/demo/app/
    dest: /var/www/demo
    mode: 0755
  notify: restart apache2
  ```
[ansible copy module](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/copy_module.html)

Now we have our files in the correct location we can point the webserver to our new site.

First lets copy our configuration file to the available site folder

```yml
- name: copy apache virtual host config
  copy:
    src: /tmp/demo/demo.conf
    dest: /etc/apache2/sites-available
  notify: restart apache2
  ```
  Then lets set up a python virtual environment. We do this so we can give each application its own set of libraries while still using the same version of python. To do this we will point the ansible pip module to our requirements.txt file.
  
  ```yml
  - name: setup python virtualenv
  pip:
    requirements: /var/www/demo/requirements.txt
    virtualenv: /var/www/demo/.venv
  notify: restart apache2
  ```
  The virtualenv parameter sets up our .venv file which the environment runs off of.
  ```yml
  - name: de-activate default apache site
  file:
    path: /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
    state: absent
  notify: restart apache2
  ```
  [ansible pip module](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/pip_module.html)
  ## Activating the site
  Our final plays require us to de-activate the default site and enable our new one.
  
  ```yml
  - name: de-activate default apache site
  file:
    path: /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
    state: absent
  notify: restart apache2

- name: activate demo apache site
  file:
    src: /etc/apache2/sites-available/demo.conf
    dest: /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/demo.conf
    state: link
  notify: restart apache2
```
Ensure that the state pointing towards are config file is link. This will create a symlink to the original file.

## Playbook
```yml

    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
    update_cache: yes
  with_items:
    - "{{ pythonreq }}"

- name: ensure apache2 started
  service:
    name: apache2
    state: started
    enabled: yes

- name: ensure mod_wsgi enabled
  apache2_module:
    state: present
    name: wsgi
  notify: restart apache2

- name: clone demo app source
  git:
    dest: /tmp/demo
    repo: https://Pudd1ng@gitlab.com/Pudd1ng/DemoFlask.git
  notify: restart apache2

- name: copy demo app files
  copy:
    src: /tmp/demo/app/
    dest: /var/www/demo
    mode: 0755
  notify: restart apache2

- name: copy apache virtual host config
  copy:
    src: /tmp/demo/demo.conf
    dest: /etc/apache2/sites-available
  notify: restart apache2

- name: setup python virtualenv
  pip:
    requirements: /var/www/demo/requirements.txt
    virtualenv: /var/www/demo/.venv
  notify: restart apache2

- name: de-activate default apache site
  file:
    path: /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
    state: absent
  notify: restart apache2

- name: activate demo apache site
  file:
    src: /etc/apache2/sites-available/demo.conf
    dest: /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/demo.conf
