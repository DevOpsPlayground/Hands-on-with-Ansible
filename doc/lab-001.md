LAB1 ~ Python lib

Now that our environment is configured we need to set up a structure to start
creating our playbooks and roles.

Note that when we are creating playbooks and roles we will always be doing it
in the /ansible directory on the control machine. For this lab we will be
working here.

The first is to create a folder for our roles. `sudo mkdir roles`

Swap to our new roles directory and lets start creating a templated structure
for our own roles. Run the following commannd `ansible-galaxy init
[yourname].pythonenv`

This will create the following folder structure:

files - 
meta -
templates - 
vars -
defaults - 
handlers -
tasks - 
tests -

Head into the tasks and open the main.yml file and we can start constructing
the plays required to configure our webserver for our python flask app.
